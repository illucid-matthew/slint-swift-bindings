# ðŸš¨ Incomplete

These are incomplete, untested, and partial implementations of Slint core types.

These were some of the first things written, as an experiment of how a Swift API following the C++ API would look.
Many of the things I learned in these early attempts directly translated into the rest of the code.

> Except for the interpreter stuff. I'm too tired to figure that out. I want to be done with this.

But none of these are tested.
They will all need significant work to build.

I'm putting these here not because they are usable, but because they might be if reworked.
There's a non-trivial amount of effort in these.
